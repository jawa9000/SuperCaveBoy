# About
Super Cave Boy is my second attempt at learning to make games using GameMaker Studio. While I did follow the instruction provided in http://learn.heartbeast.co/courses/enrolled/make-a-platform-game, I took it upon myself to get a little creative along the way.

Sometimes when the player jumps into a corner (head first), it becomes stuck and can't break free. That is why I included a feature to restart the level (see above).
